# Advanced Data Types

## Lists (familiar face)
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable, can add, replace or remove) collections of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (unchangeable, replace) collections of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in parenthesis/ small brackets ().
